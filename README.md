# MODEL_SATALLITE_STM_32_C2

A satellite board model was designed using the Altium Designer program. It is capable of collecting air pressure data using a BMP280 pressure sensor, velocity and axis data using a MPU6050 GYRO IC, and position information using a GPS module. The collected data is sent to a ground station using an XBee wireless module connector. The board also includes an SD card to save all the collected data. The STM32F101 microcontroller unit (MCU) is used to control all of theseÂ components.
